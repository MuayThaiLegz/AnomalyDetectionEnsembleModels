# AnomalyDetectionEnsembleModels

### A Comprehensive Ensemble-Based Approach to Anomaly Detection

This repository showcases a series of ensemble models for detecting anomalies across diverse datasets, designed to leverage the strengths of multiple anomaly detection techniques. It serves as a demonstration of advanced ensemble methods, adaptive tuning, and regularization techniques, providing a robust foundation for academic research, data analysis, and machine learning applications.

## Overview

Anomaly detection is critical in various domains, including finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and cybersecurity, where identifying outliers can highlight issues ranging from fraudulent activities to system malfunctions. This project provides a unified approach to anomaly detection, combining classical, machine learning, and deep learning methods within ensemble frameworks to improve anomaly detection accuracy and adaptability across different data distributions.

### Key Features:
- **Unified Outlier Detection Model**: Combines multiple classical and machine learning outlier detection techniques, applying regularization and normalization to create a unified outlier score.
- **Anomaly Detection Ensemble**: Integrates traditional models (e.g., Isolation Forest, One-Class SVM) with an autoencoder for non-linear anomaly detection, achieving high accuracy across non-linear datasets.
- **Fast Anomaly Ensemble**: Utilizes adaptive parameter tuning, clustering, and density-based methods for rapid and scalable anomaly detection.
